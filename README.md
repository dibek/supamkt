Super market test exercise

The test implements the rule engine and but not the printing of the items (not clear if it is requested by specification)
as well the rule find items following the (or each N (equals) items X, you get K items Y for free) but not implements the list of Y items .
It doesn't take few hours otherwise.
Good luck with the research , I had fun but my time is limited.
